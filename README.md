# OS-Projects

Operating systems course projects from which I got a good knowledge about Linux system calls in C, inter-process communication mechanisms 
and work experience with multi-thread and multi-process applications synchronization using semaphores or mutexes.

In the first project I worked with the structure of a specific file. I parsed the file, indentify certain sections of it and extract data 
from them.

The second project was all about multi-process and multi-thread synchronization (using mutexes, semaphores or conditional variables) 
in different and various situations.

The third project familiarized me with inter-process communication mecannisms such as pipes, shared memory and memory-file mapping.
